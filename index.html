        <li>
          Along with working as a full time Software Engineer at Suncorp,
          assisted in reworking the company’s official website. Led the
          development and collaborated with the CEO of SP Solutions on
          specifications and content required on each page.
        </li>
        <li>
          We migrated the previous website from CMS, which is more prone to
          security issues, to web hosting. My contributions were mostly the
          frontend side of the project, working with redesigns and adding new
          content and information for improved responsiveness with a focus on
          UX.
        </li>
        <li>
          The website is now live and being used by our current and potential
          clients, with more developers jumping on board to help maintain and
          add new features to the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided support to senior developers in different FileNet projects
          for external clients, as well as in-house projects.

        <li>
          Built and deployed an end-to-end FileNet system alongside a small
          team. Which was developed to facilitate the transition to a paperless
          insurance underwriting process and increased automation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed in Java with IBM Content Manager to handle the volume
          required for enterprise workflows. Collaborated with customers in
          weekly meetings for gathering specs and testing solutions for the
          underwriting process. Worked with senior developers and other teams
          for deployment. Followed Agile methodologies for the project,
          including daily standups, sprints, and retros.
        </li>
        <li>
          My contributions included, but not limited to, testing and liaising
